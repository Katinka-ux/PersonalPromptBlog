# About This Blog

Welcome to the Prompt Engineering Blog! This site is dedicated to the emerging field of prompt engineering for AI systems.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs to AI systems to get the most effective outputs. As language models and other AI systems become more powerful and widespread, the skill of crafting effective prompts becomes increasingly valuable.
