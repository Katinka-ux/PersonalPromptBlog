    "content": "Prompt engineering is rapidly becoming one of the most critical skills in the age of AI. As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and others become more integrated into our workflows, the ability to craft effective prompts is becoming essential for developers, content creators, researchers, and business professionals. At its core, prompt engineering is the practice of crafting inputs to AI systems to generate the desired outputs. Think of it as learning to communicate effectively with an AIâ€”understanding how to phrase your requests to get the most useful, accurate, and relevant responses.",
